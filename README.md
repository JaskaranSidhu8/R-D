### General information about the project

Tiebreaker is an AI-powered SaaS application designed to make group dining decisions simple and data-driven. Planning a group dinner often leads to frustration due to everyone’s different tastes, but Tiebreaker eliminates the endless back-and-forths by offering smart, collaborative restaurant suggestions.

Each user creates an account and completes a short survey capturing preferences such as cuisine types, price ranges, dietary restrictions, and even ambiance preferences. When planning a group outing, the app uses a collaborative filtering algorithm to evaluate the group’s collective preferences and suggest restaurant options that offer the best compromise for all members.

By integrating with real-time restaurant APIs like Yelp or Google Places, Tiebreaker provides up-to-date information on menus, pricing, location, and ratings, ensuring that the group’s final decision is not only personalized but also based on real-time data. The result? A list of restaurant options that optimizes satisfaction for the whole group, making dining decisions both fair and enjoyable.
